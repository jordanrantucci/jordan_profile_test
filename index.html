            <p>
                I am Jordan Rantucci a 31 year old microbiologist living in Eastlake, Ohio. I have had an interest in
                coding for the last few years, but have not had a chance to dive into it.
                I have finally taken the plunge due to COVID to have the time to learn the skill. A few things I like to
                do for fun are stay active with hikes and bike rides.
                I love to travel and would like to see as much of the world as possible. I also love to challenge myself
                and I feel like learning to code will be a difficult, but rewarding challenge.
